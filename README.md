QlikViewManagementWs
====================

QlikView Self Hosting (no iis needed) Management Ws

This pproject MUST run with Administrator Privileges,
otherwise the self host service wont start.

when working with visual studio, 
first open VS using right click and choosing: 'Run as administrator'
then open the project location.

you cant run the client and self host at the same time from VS (unless you open two VS windows or split the project)

but you can run one by going to the Bin folder and the other using debug.

Enjoy!.
